## Project Description

**SLIP2SLEEP** is a retro-style physics calculator that determines the speed at which you’ll slip and fall based on surface analysis, object identification, and basic personal data. It uses AI-powered image analysis and real physics formulas — all wrapped in a neon 8-bit aesthetic.
**New Feature:** You can even prepare for the inevitable — by adding your name, dates, and photo to a virtual tombstone for comedic effect after seeing your “fatal” slip speed.

## The Problem (that doesn’t exist)

People slip and fall every day… but how fast are they going when they do it? And more importantly, what if we could skip straight to designing the tombstone? We live in a world full of unanswered, unnecessary questions — and this is one of them.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

**SLIP2SLEEP** takes images of surfaces and footwear, runs them through a pixel-by-pixel friction analysis, then uses physics formulas to tell you exactly how fast you’ll be eating the floor. For added drama, you can upload your photo and details to instantly generate a stylish digital tombstone to commemorate your glorious wipeout.

## Technical Details
 **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Image Processing**: Canvas API for pixel analysis
- **Physics Engine**: Custom calculations based on real physics formulas
- **Responsive**: CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout
- **Animations**: CSS keyframes and JavaScript animations

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**

* **Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Frameworks:** None (pure web magic)
* **Libraries:** Canvas API (for pixel analysis), custom tombstone generator module
* **Tools:** Web browser, code editor, image assets

## Implementation:
**For Software:**
How It Works
Surface Analysis
User uploads an image of the surface they are walking on.
AI analyzes brightness and texture to determine the friction coefficient.
Darker surfaces = higher friction, lighter surfaces = lower friction.
Object Analysis
User uploads an image of their footwear or the object they are slipping on.
AI analyzes color distribution to identify material properties.
Material type influences the overall friction coefficient.
Personal Data Input
User enters weight and height.
These values are used in physics calculations for accurate results.
Physics Engine Calculations
Applies real physics formulas:
Potential Energy = m × g × h
Kinetic Energy = Potential Energy − Work Done by Friction
Final Velocity = √(2 × Kinetic Energy / mass)
Fall Duration = √(2 × height / gravity)
Impact Force = weight × gravity × (1 + velocity/gravity)
Retro Gaming Style Output
Results are displayed in neon green and pink 8-bit style with smooth transitions and retro feedback.
Optional tombstone generator creates a humorous “memorial” image with your photo and details based on your calculated slip speed.
**Installation**

```bash
# No installation needed — just clone and open
git clone [repo-link]
```

**Run**

```bash
# Open in your default browser
open index.html
```
